# workout-generator

Overview: Users can input their personal information (such as height, weight, etc.) and their fitness experience through the front-end interface. This allows the system to generate several fitness plans for them. Then, the front-end sends a signal to the back-end. After the back-end generates the data, it creates a system for convenient check-ins.
